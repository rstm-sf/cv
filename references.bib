	abstract = {We present an architecture of a cloud-based quantum computing platform. It is based on the original model of a nanophotonic quantum processor with integrated quantum memory and a quantum transistor. At the moment the platform works with an integrated quantum simulator that implements the behavior of the underlying model.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the results of development and testing of parallel program, designed for the solution on hybrid cluster systems with NVIDIA graphics processors of big and sparse systems of linear algebraic equations, in particular arising in the numerical simulations of multiphase fluid flows in porous media. Systems of linear algebraic equations are solved using Krylov subspace iterative methods with different preconditioners: block modifications of incomplete LU factorization and two-step CPR preconditioner. Our solver was developed using MPI, CUDA and following optimized mathematical libraries: NVIDIA cuBLAS, cuSPARSE and AmgX.},
